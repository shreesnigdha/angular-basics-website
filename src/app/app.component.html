  <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

  <p>Angular was formerly introduced by Google corporation in 2012 and was considered to be one of the most promising among JavaScript frameworks. It was written completely in JavaScript to separate an application’s logic from DOM manipulation, aiming at dynamic page updates. Angular introduced many powerful features enabling the developer to effortlessly create rich and single-page applications.</p>

  <div><h3>History</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Naming:</b> The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.</li>
    <li><b>Version 2:</b> Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22–23. October 2014. The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers. On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015, and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on September 14, 2016.</li>
    <li><b>Version 4:</b> On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0. The final version was released on March 23, 2017. Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2. Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.
      <br><br>Features in version 4.3
      <ul>
      <li>Introducing HttpClient, a smaller, easier to use, and more powerful library for making HTTP Requests.
      <li>New router life cycle events for Guards and Resolvers. Four new events: GuardsCheckStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart, ResolveEnd join the existing set of life cycle event such as NavigationStart.
      <li>Conditionally disable animations.</ul></li>
    <li><b>Version 5:</b> Angular 5 was released on November 1, 2017. Key improvements in Angular 5 include support for progressive web apps, a build optimizer and improvements related to Material Design.</li>
    <li><b>Version 6:</b> Angular 6 was released on May 4, 2018. This is a major release focused less on the underlying framework and more on the toolchain and on making it easier to move quickly with Angular in the future, like: ng update, ng add, Angular Elements, Angular Material + CDK Components, Angular Material Starter Components, CLI Workspaces, Library Support, Tree Shakable Providers, Animations Performance Improvements, and RxJS v6.</li>
    <li><b>Version 7:</b> Angular 7 was released on October 18, 2018. Updates regarding Application Performance, Angular Material & CDK, Virtual Scrolling, Improved Accessibility of Selects, now supports Content Projection using web standard for custom elements, and dependency updates regarding Typescript 3.1, RxJS 6.3, Node 10 (still supporting Node 8).</li>
    <li><b>Version 8:</b> Angular 8 was released on May 28, 2019. Featuring Differential loading for all application code, Dynamic imports for lazy routes, Web workers, TypeScript 3.4 support, and Angular Ivy as an opt-in preview.
    <li><b>Version 9:</b> Angular 9 was released on February 6, 2020. Version 9 moves all applications to use the Ivy compiler and runtime by default. Angular has been updated to work with TypeScript 3.6 and 3.7.</li>
    <li><b>Version 10:</b> Angular 10 was released on June 24, 2020.</li>
    <li><b>Version 11:</b> Angular 11 was released on November 11, 2020.</li>
    <li><b>Version 12:</b> Angular 12 was released on May 12, 2021.</li>

<div><h3 style="text-align: center">Why Do You Need a Framework?</h3>
  <img src="https://essencesolusoft.com/assets/services/angular/angular_img1.png" alt ="angular" width="400px" height="350px" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Frameworks in general boost web development efficiency and performance by providing a consistent structure so that developers don’t have to keep rebuilding code from scratch. Frameworks are time savers that offer developers a host of extra features that can be added to software without requiring extra effort.</p>
  <h3>Why Angular?</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications.
    <br>But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not.
    <br>These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own</p>
  <h3>Features of Angular</h3>

  <p>1. Document Object Model<br>2. TypeScript<br>3. Data Binding<br>4. Testing</p>
  <h3>Advantages of Angular</h3>
  <p>1. Effective Cross-Platform Development. <br>
    2. High Quality of the Application.<br>
    3. Improved Speed and Performance.<br>
    4. Faster Development Process.<br>
    5. Readable and Testable Code.<br>
    6. More Lightweight Web Applications.<br>
    7. Efficient Problem-Solving Patterns.<br>
    8. Excellent Material Design Library.</p>
